:construction: We're just getting started, so apologies that this is UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

At the moment @tansaku has started up this project so for anything please ask him, but in order to contribute please join the AgileVentures slack and join the #bots channel where you can say hi.

Of course you can just submit pull requests, which should be associated with issues - please use branch names prefixed with the issue id, and put `fixes #issue_number` in the PR description so everything links up.

At the moment we are just working off master and deploying that to Azure/Dokku
